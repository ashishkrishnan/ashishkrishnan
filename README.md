### Hi, Foo ðŸ‘‹

#### Here are few things about me
I work as a Product Engineer at [GoJek](https://www.gojek.io), India. Previously at kite.work

Currently, excited & hooked to Functional, Reactive Programming.
Strong proponent of test-driven pragmatic engineering practices & open-source.

Started off in 2013-14 with a crazy idea of building an OS on top of Android - failed, parked.

Sometimes, I write my thoughts here: [ashishkrishnan.blog](https://ashishkrishnan.blog)
